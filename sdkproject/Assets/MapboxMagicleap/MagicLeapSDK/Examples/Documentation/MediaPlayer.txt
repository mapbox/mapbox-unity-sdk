# Example Scene: Media Player

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using the
Media Player API and showcases the use of digital rights management (DRM) technology.
This example needs a controller to work with the User Interface and Internet access
in order to validate DRM.

The controller acts as a virtual pointer. A ray coming out of the controller model
indicates where the controller is pointing at. If the controller is pointing at an
interactable interface, the ray cursor is a yellow circle. Pull the trigger
to activate the interface and change the cursor color green.

Note:
- If you use a DRM protected video, you must supply the corresponding
  license server for it.
- If you use a DRM-free video, the license server must be left blank
- For online media, enter the URL of the video
- For local media, the video should be placed inside a StreamingAssets folder
  and the URL should be relative to StreamingAssets
See MediaPlayerExample.cs for more information.
