# Example Scene: Planes

Description:
This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for detecting
surfaces and displaying planes.

The scene detects surfaces and displays the planes in your environment as you
look around. Planes can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonals, and the scene
textures surfaces differently according to both untagged and semantically tagged
planes (floors, walls, ceiling).

The UI text depicts the current number of planes and the maximum number of
possible planes.

## Bumper
Toggles the texturing mode for planes.

## Home Button
Switch plane query extents between bounded and boundless.

## Swipe Right/Left
Modify texturing parameters based on the semantic tag of the planes
the cursor is positioned over.
