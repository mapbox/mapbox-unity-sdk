# Example Scene: Controller

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for receiving input
from the Control controller and sending haptic feedback to it.

When a controller is connected, a controller model will appear and stats about
it will show up on the UI. This controller model will follow your physical controller
with 6dof (rotational and positional data). A second model with the same characteristics
will appear when a second controller is connected.

When a controller is disconnected, the model mapped to the disconnected controller will
disappear and the UI mapped to this controller will display the status as disconnected.

## Bumper
When you press the Bumper:
- The bumper in the controller model will change colors.
- A haptic ForceDown body vibration effect occurs onButtonDown.
- A haptic ForceUp body vibration effect occurs onButtonUp.
- If CFUID (Coordinate Frame Unique ID) based tracking is enabled (which is on by default
in the examples on device), it would toggle whether to use it or or not. When CFUID tracking is disabled
it has no effect.

## Home Button
When you release the Home Button:
- The home button in the controller model will light up for a small duration.

## Trigger
When you squeeze the Trigger:
- The trigger in the controller model moves to match the physical controller and
  the color will change based on the trigger value.
- A haptic Buzz body vibration effect occurs on the controller. The intensity is based on
  Trigger pressure.

## Touchpad
When you touch the Touchpad:
- The touchpad in the controller model will change colors based on the pressure value.
- A small visualizer will appear at the position touched on the touchpad.
- The touchpad gesture is shown on the UI.
