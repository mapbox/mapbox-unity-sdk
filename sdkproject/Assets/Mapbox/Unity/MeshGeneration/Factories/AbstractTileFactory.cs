	/// <summary>
	/// Factories
	/// Factories corresponds to Mapbox Api endpoints for the most part.Terrain factory uses terrain rgb api,
	/// Image factory uses raster image api and vector tile factory uses vector data api.
	/// Only exception to this at the moment is Directions factory, which is a monobehaviour in Drive demo scene
	/// but we’ll probably rework that in the future as well.
	/// Factories do the api calls.They are responsible for reporting progress and logging/reporting any network issue.
	/// They can also keep track of tiles if necessary (i.e.update/refresh data after initial creation)
	/// Factories processes the received data in different ways.
	/// Terrain factories creates the mesh from the received data (or a flat terrain depending the settings)
	/// MapImage factory applies received image to tile game object.
	/// Vector Tile Factory deals with a much more complex and detailed data compared to other two so it doesn’t do the
	/// whole processing itself and uses some subclasses (LayerVisualizers) to do it.
	/// Creating a custom factory is a good idea if you want to fetch raw data and process is in a totally different
	/// custom way, like creating terrain and then cut off water areas from terrain mesh.
	/// Vector Tile factory, for example, is built to be flexible and work with multiple vector layers. But if you
	/// don’t need that all, you can create a custom version of it and process what you need in a much more concrete
	/// and performant way.
	/// Another example here would be custom terrain mesh. Current terrain factories work with a custom sized grid
	/// and apply height data on that. By creating a custom terrain factory, you can have a custom mesh instead of a grid,
	/// optimize and minimize vertex count etc.
