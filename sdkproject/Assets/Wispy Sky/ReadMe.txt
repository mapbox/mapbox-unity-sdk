Description
Wispy Skybox contains one skybox with the sun at 15 degrees elevation, blue skies and altocumulus clouds. Each texture is set to 2048, the original render resolution. Also included are the spherical renders in PSD(zipped) and in EXR formats in the Extras folder.

There are three materials:
1) WispySkyboxMat - Standard Unity Skybox with the textures applied.
2) WispySkyboxMobileMat - standard Unity mobile Skybox with the textures applied.
3) WispySkyboxCubeMat - Standard Unity RenderFX/Skybox which uses a cubemap to reduce the number of draw calls.
