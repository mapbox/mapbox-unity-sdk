## Attribution

All uses of Mapbox’s custom maps and data must attribute both Mapbox and the appropriate data providers. Mapbox’s custom design is copyrighted and our data sources require attribution. This requirement extends to all plan levels.

You must include the the [Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice](https://www.mapbox.com/help/attribution/) on any map that uses the Mapbox Maps SDK for Unity. We provide with the SDK an `Attribution` prefab that includes all required information. This prefab utilizes UGUI for integration and customization. You may adjust the position of the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice (pivots and anchors of the rect transform), but they must remain visible on the map. You may also change the background color of the rect transform and the text color of the text attribution notice to best match your design aesthetics, but all information must be clearly legible. You may not otherwise alter the Mapbox wordmark or text attribution notice. If you wish to otherwise relocate or to remove the Mapbox wordmark, please contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@mapbox.com) to discuss options available under our Enterprise plans.
